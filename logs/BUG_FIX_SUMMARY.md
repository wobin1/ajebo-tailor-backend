# Order Creation Bug Fix Summary

## Problem
Order creation was failing with a 422 Unprocessable Entity error.

## Root Cause
**Type Mismatch in Address Validation**

The `_get_user_address()` method was comparing:
- `address_exists['user_id']` (UUID object from database)
- `user_id` (string parameter)

Even when the UUIDs were identical, the comparison `address_exists['user_id'] != user_id` was returning `True` because:
- UUID('231eeb5a-d43e-4a90-bc15-af8771784405') != '231eeb5a-d43e-4a90-bc15-af8771784405'

## Solution
Convert the UUID to string before comparison:
```python
address_user_id = str(address_exists['user_id'])
if address_user_id != user_id:
    raise ValidationError(f"Address does not belong to user")
```

## Files Modified
1. `/Applications/wobin/ajebo-tailor/backend-api/src/modules/orders/manager.py`
   - Fixed `_get_user_address()` method (line ~439)
   - Added comprehensive error logging
   - Added debug print statements

2. `/Applications/wobin/ajebo-tailor/backend-api/src/modules/orders/router.py`
   - Enhanced error logging in `create_order()` endpoint
   - Now logs detailed error messages and stack traces

## Testing
After the fix, orders should be created successfully with:
```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "product_id": "valid-product-uuid",
            "quantity": 1,
            "size": "M",
            "color": "Black",
            "customizations": {}
        }
    ],
    "shipping_address_id": "user-address-uuid",
    "billing_address_id": "user-address-uuid",
    "payment_method": "card"
}
```

## Additional Improvements
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Better error messages that specify exactly what went wrong
- Validation now checks:
  1. Address exists
  2. Address belongs to correct user
  3. Product exists and is active
  4. Sufficient stock available

## Next Steps
Once confirmed working, remove debug print statements for production.
